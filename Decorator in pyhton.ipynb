    "## 20. Decorator in Python\n",
    "* Decorator provides a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions.\n",
    "* By definition, a decorator is a function that takes other functions and extends their behaviours without modifying them.\n",
    "* Decorators can be extremely useful as they allow the extension of an existing function, without any modification to the original function source code.\n",
    "* In fact, there are two types of decorators in Python: class decorator and function decorator.\n",
    "* In application, decorators are mainly used in creating a middle layer in the backend, which performs tasks like token authentication, image compression, validation, and many more."
